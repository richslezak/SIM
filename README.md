# Sound in Motion

## Original SIM website was built around 2000

The [original website](http://www.sound-in-motion.com/) is still functioning however it's not mobile friendly.
This is why the website is being [rebuild](https://soundinmotion.netlify.app/) in 2023 :)

## This site is built using [Astro](https://astro.build)
