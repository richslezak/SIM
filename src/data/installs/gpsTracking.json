    "install_description": "Do you own a fleet of vehicles driven by employees, or just want to know where your teenager is? Tracking systems can cover real-time or downloadable information letting you know when the vehicle was driven, where it went, how fast it went, where it stopped and anything else you desire. The real-time or active systems can also help in case a vehicle is stolen or driven beyond a designated perimeter. This is called &quot;Geofencing&quot;."
