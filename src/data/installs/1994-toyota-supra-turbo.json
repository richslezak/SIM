This picture was taken at the 2000 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, while on display in the MB Quart booth. MB Quart had sponsored the Q-series and Reference-series speakers used in the install. We also would like to thank Phoenix Gold, Fujitsu Ten (Eclipse) and JL Audio for their sponsorship and support."

The result was a 7\" Focal Polykevlar Midbass driver in its own enclosure within a body cavity. This created intense bass-presence up front."

An ABS enclosure was constructed in the fender well inches behind the front tire. The speaker then fires into the listening area with minimal path length differences.

For regular (sound quality) listening, only the outside two of the three JL Audio 10W6 are being used. Each has its own 0.6 cu.ft. sealed enclosure with the center sub having a very small airtight steel enclosure around it. (See following picture). This steel enclosure has two airtight doors that can be opened electronically to allow all three subwoofers to play in one common enclosure. This is only used to achieve maximum SPL during competition. In this setting a Phoenix Gold Bass Qube is engaged as well that is precisely tuned to the resonant frequency of all three woofers in a single enclosure. All this is documented with a small B/W camera inside the enclosure showing the mechanics and how the doors open and close."
