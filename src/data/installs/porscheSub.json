    "install_description": "We have tried many different approaches to getting clean tight bass into these cars without compromising esthetics or functionality. This subwoofer enclosure sits in the passenger footwell perfectly and features a 10&quot; Diamond Audio driver that handles 150 Watts RMS. The sound is rich, deep and clean. Even in convertibles, for which we originally designed it. The carpet is Porsche carpet and the match is usually perfect or very close, though we can't guarantee it. Note: Will not work with factory BOSE subwoofer mounted to the side of the console.",
