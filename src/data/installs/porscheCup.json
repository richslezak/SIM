But sometimes on that long cruise or distant trek to the track, don't you wish you had a place to put your drink? This was inspired by our customers request for the early models that didn't offer a factory cup holder. We made a few and the response was phenomenal. Constructed out of 6mm &#40;&#189;&quot;&#41; ABS plastic and contoured to the perfect angle with a 73mm &#40;2 &#x215E;&quot;&#41; opening, it slides in securely between the lower and upper console.",
