    "install_description": "This being one of the hottest new ways of receiving media, satellite radio has made a huge impact. Hundreds of stations are available with real-time sports scores, stocks, weather, traffic, artist and song information. Most popular are add-on units for people that do not wish to change the radio. We pay particular attention to make the unit disappear in the car while being easy to use. Another important aspect is the installation and location of the antenna. We take extra time with this to ensure long trouble free performance and a non-obtrusive look.",
