I have a BMW M3 and Sound in Motion took a gorgeous factory car and made it even better! With such a compact car the sound is awesome, all of the equipment works flawlessly. Their installation was careful and thorough. Every single person who works at Sound in Motion has a smile on their face, and is happy to help out whenever I have a question. Each worker is an absolute expert, and I would not take my car anywhere else. When they had my car, Sound In Motion took time not to miss anything, and spent days making sure my system worked perfectly. They called to update me and let me have complete control over each aspect of the system. The result is an amazing, crisp sound that is better than anything else I have heard. I trust them with everything, from the speakers and the amps, to the DVD player and the iPod hook up they installed for me. Their customization to my needs was great, they listen to their customers. Sound in Motion completely hooked me up. Sound in Motion is THE BEST!",

I recently purchased a 2006 VW Jetta and although the factory radio offered intuitive operation, the overall sound quality was less than unacceptable, in fact, it was terrible. Having built a competition car audio system that was undefeated back in 1994, I understand the three things that are required to successfully design and install a high end car audio system: sound quality, installation integrity and proper aesthetics. Although I wasn't looking to create an exotic system, these three items were still important to me today. The guys at Sound in Motion nailed it! They actually listened to my needs, updated me about the past 10 years of mobile electronics, and most importantly delivered the solution I was looking for: OEM factory looks, rugged installation, and sound quality beyond my expectations. If you are thinking about upgrading your current stereo system, be sure to visit Sound in Motion. Tell them what you expect, apply their recommendations, and drive away with the unbelievable results that I did!",

Their craftsmanship is second to none. They claim to eat and breathe this stuff in their off-hours. After seeing several of their projects up close, I believe them.

I used to be a Do-It-Yourselfer (DIY) when it came to automotive sound and I came up with an OK system. But that was my old car. For my new car I wanted to take no chances on getting the best possible sound system, so I phoned Jim at Sound in Motion and we worked out a plan and a schedule. Well, let me tell you that SIM came through with a stellar system, ahead of schedule, under budget and totally stealth! So when you are ready to run with the big dogs, \"don't try this at home\" as they say, but let Sound in Motion take the guess-work out of installing the killer system. I did and I have never been happier.",

There is a big difference between a recent, highly engineered recording and a 1950s live jazz recording. The bass is fantastic! There are bass lines that with the old system would have been inaudible or distorted. With high quality recordings the presence of the sound is amazing, and with some older recordings you can here studio chatter clearly or even guitarists' fingers sliding on acoustic strings.
