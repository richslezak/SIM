Now there's real bass! We're actually looking forward to some long drives. On top of it all, Sound in Motion was a pleasure to work with. Thanks."

      "comment": "Sound In Motion is the best car stereo shop. After careful consideration I decided that they are the experts of New England! I have a BMW M3 and Sound in Motion took a gorgeous factory car and made it even better! With such a compact car the sound is awesome, all of the equipment works flawlessly. Their installation was careful and thorough. Every single person who works at Sound in Motion has a smile on their face, and is happy to help out whenever I have a question. Each worker is an absolute expert, and I would not take my car anywhere else. When they had my car, Sound In Motion took time not to miss anything, and spent days making sure my system worked perfectly. They called to update me and let me have complete control over each aspect of the system. The result is an amazing, crisp sound that is better than anything else I have heard. I trust them with everything, from the speakers and the amps, to the DVD player and the iPod hook up they installed for me. Their customization to my needs was great, they listen to their customers. Sound in Motion completely hooked me up. Sound in Motion is THE BEST!",
