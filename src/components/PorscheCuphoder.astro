<h3>A Cup Holder for Your Early Porsche Boxster or 996</h3>
<p>
  I know, I know we shouldn't be distracted by our beverage while driving. But sometimes on that
  long cruise or distant trek to the track, don't you wish you had a place to put your drink? This
  was inspired by our customers request for the early models that didn't offer a factory cup holder.
  We made a few and the response was phenomenal. Constructed out of 6mm (½") ABS plastic and
  contoured to the perfect angle with a 73mm (2 ⅞") opening, it slides in securely between the lower
  and upper console.
