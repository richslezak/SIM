              </h2>
              <p class="lead">
                Owner, cleanup crew, system designer & fabricator. Born in Munich Germany Derek grew
                up being exposed to high end home audio systems from his parents HiFi import and
                distribution business. The seed was planted early, but not being able to afford a
                house, he directed his teenage years toward Car Audio. And Yes, he had a complete
                amplified car audio system functioning in his bedroom before purchasing his first
                car. Over the years the caliper and complexity of the systems grew substantially.
                After he was introduced to IASCA, the competition bug set in. Even more elaborate
                systems were built and car audio competitions were attended and won all over the
                country. Derek is also an aviation enthusiast, private pilot and loves to be
                outside, travel and spend time with his family.
