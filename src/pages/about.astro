            Our Mission is to offer the greatest possible results within a given budget. We
            specialize in OEM aesthetic integration, meaning we strive to not detract from the
            original look or functionality of the vehicle, no matter how rare, or common. We go to
            great lengths to source materials that match the interior in color, feel and texture as
            well as hide components in sensible, safe, but serviceable locations. The end result
            should be a greatly improved OEM experience, not a complicated mess of added "stuff".

              </h2>
              <p class="lead">
                Owner, born in Munich Germany, Derek grew up being exposed to high end home audio
                systems from his parents HiFi import and distribution business. The seed was planted
                early, but not being able to afford a house for home audio, he directed his teenage
                years toward Car Audio. And yes, he had a complete amplified car audio system
                functioning in his bedro om before even purchasing his first car. Over the years the
                caliber and complexity of the systems grew substantially. After he was introduced to
                IASCA, the competition bug set in. Even more elaborate systems were built and car
                audio competitions were attended and won all over the country. This led him to a job
                offer working at MB Quart for a few years prior to purchasing Sound in Motion in
                1996. Derek is also an aviation enthusiast, private pilot and loves to be outside,
                travel and spend time with his family.
