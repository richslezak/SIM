          Never mind parking, or backing up to your trailer. Did you know that over 50 kids get
          backed over every week and over 500 have died in the last ten years, from being backed
          over by a vehicle usually driven by a parent, grandparent or neighbor? (According to USA
          Today) Studies of rear cameras conducted by Consumer's Union, showed they were "extremely
          effective" for preventing back-overs, say senior product safety counsel Sally Greenberg.
