        We have tried many different approaches to getting clean tight bass into these cars without
        compromising esthetics or functionality. This subwoofer enclosure sits in the passenger
        footwell perfectly and features a 10" Diamond Audio driver that handles 150 Watts RMS. The
        sound is rich, deep and clean. Even in convertibles, for which we originally designed it.
        The carpet is either standard or Porsche factory carpet and the match is usually perfect or
        very close, though we can't guarantee it. Note: Will not work with factory BOSE subwoofer
        mounted to the side of the console.
