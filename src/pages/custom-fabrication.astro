          Through the use of different materials and fabrication methods, we efficiently construct
          pretty much anything, with extreme durability while keeping the weight down. Two-part
          epoxies and the vast improvements of flexible paint coatings have made plastic fabrication
          one of our fortes. We pay careful attention to matching OEM colors, textures and shades.
          The car manufactures use plastic throughout the car, so why would you ever fiberglass a
          dashboard?
