        I know, I know we shouldn't be distracted by our beverage while driving. But sometimes on
        that long cruise or distant trek to the track, don't you wish you had a place to put your
        drink? This was inspired by our customers request for the early models that didn't offer a
        factory cup holder. We made a few and the response was phenomenal. Constructed out of 6mm
        (¼") ABS plastic and contoured to the perfect angle with a 73mm (2 ⅞") opening, it slides in
        securely between the lower and upper console.
