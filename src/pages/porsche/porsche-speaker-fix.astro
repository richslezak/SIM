        As these cars become more classic, the foam on the factory speakers deteriorates rendering
        them useless. For the front speakers we usually upgrade from the original 5¼" to a 6½"
        woofer and a better tweeter in the stock location. For the rear we sell a custom mounting
        plate that will accommodate a 4" coaxial speaker as well as the stock grille for that
        original look.
