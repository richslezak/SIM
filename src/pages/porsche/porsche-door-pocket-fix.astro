        Do you own a "Modern Classic" 911? Then chances are that there is a crack in the plastic of
        your door pocket. This was a bad design from the factory and if this annoys you, we have a
        fix for it. You can either bring the car to our shop in Boston, or remove the six screws
        (don't lose the countersunk washers stuck to the carpet) and send the pockets to us. We
        clean and reseal the original plastic, and then add a reinforcement piece behind it plus
        supply a new longer screw and countersunk washer. We have been doing this fix for over ten
        years and it holds up great.
