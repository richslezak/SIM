          Just like they used to steel steering wheels with airbags, now they are stealing xenon
          headlights with high voltage transformers. Thieves are selling these $2000 headlights on
          the internet or making stun-guns with the transformers. Many owners don't even know they
          are a target until it is too late. Our proven system (explained below) has allowed many to
          have a good night sleep again.
